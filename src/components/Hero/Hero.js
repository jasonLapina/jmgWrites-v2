        <p>
          In my 20+ years of existence, I've probably spent most of my time
          reading, journaling, and dreaming of becoming a writer, and now, after
          four grueling years in college, I've finally decided to make a living
          out of the thing I love doing the most - <strong>writing!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>"But what do you do exactly?", you ask?</p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m a <strong>direct-response copywriter</strong> who writes copy that
          converts AND connects, and Iâ€™m here to help you put words to work for
          your business.
        </p>
